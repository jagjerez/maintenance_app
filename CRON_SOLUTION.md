# Vercel Cron Job Limitation Solution

## Problem
Vercel Hobby accounts are limited to **daily cron jobs only**. Your current cron expression `*/2 * * * *` (every 2 minutes) exceeds this limit.

## Solutions

### âœ… Solution 1: Use Local Cron for Development (Recommended)

You already have a complete local cron system! Use this for development and testing:

#### Start Local Cron
```bash
# Option 1: Use the script
node scripts/start-local-cron.js

# Option 2: Use curl commands
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/cron/local -d '{"action":"start"}'
```

#### Control Local Cron
```bash
# Check status
curl http://localhost:3000/api/cron/local

# Stop cron
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/cron/local -d '{"action":"stop"}'

# Process jobs manually
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/cron/local -d '{"action":"process"}'
```

#### Features
- âœ… Runs every 2 minutes (configurable)
- âœ… Processes up to 10 jobs per run
- âœ… Fair processing across companies
- âœ… Prevents overlapping runs
- âœ… Manual processing capability

### âœ… Solution 2: Daily Cron for Production

Your `vercel.json` has been updated to use daily cron:
```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/process-integration-jobs",
      "schedule": "0 0 * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

This runs once daily at midnight UTC, which is compatible with Vercel Hobby.

### ðŸš€ Solution 3: Upgrade to Vercel Pro (For Production)

If you need frequent processing in production:

1. **Upgrade to Vercel Pro** ($20/month per member)
2. **Benefits:**
   - Unlimited cron jobs
   - Custom cron expressions
   - Higher function execution limits
   - Better performance

3. **Revert to frequent cron:**
   ```json
   {
     "crons": [
       {
         "path": "/api/cron/process-integration-jobs",
         "schedule": "*/2 * * * *"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

## Recommended Workflow

### Development
1. Start your Next.js app: `npm run dev`
2. Start local cron: `node scripts/start-local-cron.js`
3. Upload files and test processing

### Production (Hobby Plan)
- Use daily cron for production
- Jobs will be processed once per day
- Consider upgrading to Pro if you need more frequent processing

### Production (Pro Plan)
- Use frequent cron expressions
- Process jobs every 2 minutes as originally intended

## Current Status
- âœ… `vercel.json` updated to daily schedule
- âœ… Local cron system ready for development
- âœ… All processing logic remains unchanged
- âœ… No code changes needed in your application

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the updated `vercel.json` to Vercel
2. Use local cron for development
3. Consider upgrading to Vercel Pro if frequent processing is critical for production
